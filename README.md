## What is this repository?

In this repository, I gather all my solved problems from the past editions of the 
Murcian Programming Olympiad (OMP) and the AdaByron contest (ADA).

The proposed solutions include, for the most part, comments in Spanish.


## Where can I see the problems?

Unfortunately, these problems are not available for viewing throughout the year. 
The only way to view them is on the web page [Mooshak](http://onlinejudge.inf.um.es/~mooshak)
during the period it is open.

In some contests, the statement has been downloaded in PDF format and added to the repository (those of the OMP are in English, those of ADA in Spanish).


## How to contribute?

You can contribute with new solved problems, improvements to current solutions or even new solutions to an already solved problem.
or even new solutions for an already-solved problem. Request a *pull request* to the repository or send me a message to add it ;)
